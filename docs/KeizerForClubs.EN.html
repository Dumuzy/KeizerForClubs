<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>The KeizerForClubs software allows to manage e.g. chess tournaments
using the Keizer system with up to 100 players. <br /></p>
<h3 id="how-is-a-tournament-conducted">How is a tournament
conducted?</h3>
<p>The essential steps in brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the program, select <em>Start…</em> from the menu. Each
tournament is stored in a small database: open an existing file to
continue a tournament, choose a new file name to start a new one.</li>
<li>For a new tournament enter the names of all participating players
(if possible with rating, but it will work without also).</li>
<li>You can also enter players who are not present at the first round,
but will come later to running tournaments or add new players in later
rounds.</li>
<li>Before drawing the first or next round: set the status of all
players (present, excused etc.).</li>
<li>Now create the next round: it can be done by the program or
manually.</li>
<li>If necessary, create lists: ranking, pairings, current participants
list …</li>
<li>Exit the program until the next round.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="short-description-of-the-gui">Short description of the GUI</h3>
<p>The program is quite self-explanatory, just a few lines…</p>
<ul>
<li>In the beginning with <em>Start…</em> a tournament shall be created.
Later you can switch to another tournament with <em>Start…</em></li>
<li>Then at the left the three tabs can be selected: <em>Players</em>,
<em>Pairings</em>, <em>Settings</em>.</li>
<li>In order to add participants, just write the name and rating into
the table. Choose the status in the last column by clicking the <em>down
arrow</em> and choose from the list. ID is assigned automatically.</li>
<li>To draw a new round, select one of the menu items in the
<em>Pairing</em> menu. The instructions for manual pairing are listed
below.</li>
<li>The pairings menu is active only when the tab pairings is
selected.</li>
<li>You can display all rounds played so far using the arrow up/down
buttons beside the round number.</li>
<li>Set game results by selecting from the list (again by clicking the
<em>down arrow</em>).</li>
<li>Results can be corrected anytime (when e.g. <em>1-0</em> entered
instead of <em>0-1</em>; not required for retired participants).</li>
<li>The Lists menu is for exporting rankings etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="instructions-for-the-window-manual-pairing">Instructions for the
window <em>Manual pairing</em></h3>
<p>The menu item opens a new window, listing the names of all available
players (status <em>present</em>, has to be set before) on the left and
<em>free boards</em> on the right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click a name on he left and an empty space on the right: the player
is set to this <em>board</em>.</li>
<li>Click on a board with a name: the player returns to the left.</li>
<li>Click OK to accept entries - they will be checked before
accepted.</li>
<li>If the number of players was odd, the list on the left may contain
one name who will get the bye. On the right any <em>board</em> has to
have 2 players (or 0).</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="description-of-some-specific-scenarios">Description of some
specific scenarios</h3>
<h4 id="no-pc-in-the-playing-hall">No PC in the playing hall?</h4>
<p>Then the tournament director determines the pairings for that round
using the current ranking. Rules are described below. Later the results
of the round can be entered using <em>manual pairing</em>.</p>
<h4 id="new-players-entering-the-tournament">New players entering the
tournament</h4>
<p>Just add the name to the list: the player is immediately taken into
account for pairing and ranking.</p>
<h4 id="players-leaving-the-tournament">Players leaving the
tournament</h4>
<p>Set the status of the player to <em>retired</em>. The player will no
longer be taken into account for paring and ranking, his counterparts of
already played games get a bonus for their games. The status can be
changed back to active anytime.</p>
<p>If a player cancels before the first round, you can set his state to
<em>deleted</em>, then he’ll be deleted completely.</p>
<h4 id="rules-for-pairing">Rules for pairing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pairing is done using the players who have shown up.</li>
<li>Go top-down trough the ranking: the highest ranked plays against the
2nd ranked, 3rd - 4th and so on.</li>
<li>The ranking is sorted by Keizer points in descending order; for the
first round the rating is used.</li>
<li>Colour distribution is <em>fair</em> - the one with less white games
gets white.</li>
<li>If both equally often had white and the players already had played
aginst each other, the colours of their last game are reversed.
Otherwise white is given to the lower ranked.</li>
<li>Unlike in the Swiss system three times consecutively the same colour
might happen.</li>
<li>If an odd number of players show up: the lowest-ranked player gets a
bye.</li>
<li>Options:
<ul>
<li>The bye can go to the second lowest ranked player instead (etc.)
when double-byes shall be avoided. Also, a player who has missed a game
won’t get a bye before all other players have gotten a bye or missed a
game.</li>
<li>Pairings may be repeated after n rounds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="evaluation-parameters">Evaluation parameters</h3>
<p>In the Keizer system one can also get points when not playing. The
credit varies according to the reason for absence. For the calculation
it is assumed that you play against yourself using a percentage factor.
100% corresponds to a victory, 50% a draw and 0% to a loss.</p>
<p>The percentage values can be chosen on the settings tab. By default,
the following values are set:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% for absence due to <em>club commitments</em></li>
<li>35% for excused absence</li>
<li>35% for unexcused absence</li>
<li>75% for games against withdrawn players.</li>
<li>50% for bye</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="toughness-bonus">Toughness Bonus</h4>
<p>In KeizerForClubs, you can get some fraction of points for playing,
even if you lose. You get the toughness bonus times the
Keizer-Rank-Points of your opponent for losing a game. I recommend
values at 2-5 %.</p>
<p><em>Reasoning:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A defeat being always 0 feels a bit unfair, because if you loose
against the tournament winner, that means something different than if
you lose against the last of the tournament. Therefore in swiss system
you have what in german is called <em>Buchholz</em>, in english it is
called <em>SOS</em> or <em>sum of opponent scores</em>, in french
<em>SPA</em> or <em>somme des points des adversaires</em>. It is the sum
of all the points of your opponents. You get more <em>SOS</em> if you’ve
lost against the winner than if you’ve lost against the last. The
toughness bonus is the KeizerForClubs equivalent to <em>Buchholz</em>,
<em>SOS</em> or <em>SPA</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>With the Keizer system, players who don’t play may get
considerable amount of points. It feels unfair against those who play
and lose, that the losers all the time get zero but the avoiders still
get points.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="explanation-of-options">Explanation of options</h3>
<h4 id="rounds-before-pairings-repeat"># rounds before pairings
repeat</h4>
<p>This is the minimum number of rounds before two players may compete
against each other again.</p>
<ul>
<li>0 means two players may be paired against each other again in the
very next round.</li>
<li>99 (or any other high number) ensures two players will meet only
once in a tournament.</li>
<li>If a tournament has 7 rounds and this number is set to 2, it could
be that some pairings take place 3 times in the tournament, namely in
the 1st, 4th and 7th round.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="allocate-byes-even">Allocate bye’s even</h4>
<p>When this option is not set, the bye is always given to the lowest
ranked player when an odd number of players show up for a round.</p>
<h4 id="first-round-random">First round random</h4>
<p>In the Keizer system, the first round would be each time the same
with the same players. That may be annoying for small clubs. When
setting this value not to 0, the first round colours are random and a
random number between 0 and the value is added or subtracted from each
players rating for determining the first round pairings.</p>
<h4 id="random-board">Random board</h4>
<p>In chess, usually the strongest players play on the front boards in
tournaments. This is not good for Novuss (<em>disc billiards</em>), a
game played mainly in Latvia and Estonia.</p>
<p>Why? With Novuss, every table is slightly different because it is
made of wood. In the tournament, random tables should be assigned
because when a player plays at the same table for the second time, he
knows the specific table - so it is important that he plays at a
different table in the next game.</p>
<p>If <em>Random board</em> is checked, the board or table numbers will
be randomly assigned.</p>
<h4 id="ratio-win-against-first-to-last">Ratio win against first to
last</h4>
<p>In the Keizer system, a win against the first-ranked player gets more
points than a win against the other players.</p>
<p>This value is the points you’d get for a win against the first ranked
player divided by the points you’d get against the last ranked player.
The lower this number, the closer are Keizer system and Swiss system. 3
is the default. The higher the number, the more the better players stay
separated from the others. I recommend lower values for tournaments with
less than 20 players.</p>
<h4 id="normalization-of-victory">Normalization of victory</h4>
<p>If this checkbox is checked, all the Keizer points are normalized so
that a win against the last in the rank counts 1 Keizer point.</p>
<p>This doesn’t really change anything in the calculation of the
rankings or the pairing. But it somehow makes the Keizer points much
more graspable.</p>
<p>(In the original Keizer system the given Keizer points usually are
big whole numbers. Originally, this has probably been the case to make
the caclculations easier. It’s easier to calculate with whole numbers if
you don’t have a computer.</p>
<p>Nowadays, all the calculation is done by the computer and so we can
use much smaller but broken numbers.)</p>
<h4 id="reduce-boni-for-excusedunexcused">Reduce boni for
excused/unexcused</h4>
<p>When unchecked, the same absence boni are granted, indenpendent of
how often a player has missed. It has come out that this policy supports
missing in the tournament too much. On the other hand, we really don’t
want to punish players who just are really sick once.</p>
<p>If this checkbox is checked, the boni for excused/unexcused missing
are divided by 2 for every time a player is lacking excused/unexcused.
So e.g if the base bonus is set to 32 and a player misses 3 times, he
gets 32% for the first miss, 16% for the second and 8% for the third
miss.</p>
<h4 id="reduce-value-of-previous-rounds-place">Reduce value of previous
round’s place</h4>
<p>When unchecked, player Xyz gets the Keizer points Xyz has earned by
playing. And added to that are the Keizer points a victory against
himself would net. (Rank-Pb in the cross table.) This is very useful for
the first rounds, but feels a bit unfair for later rounds. (In reality,
it doesn’t matter much mostly.)</p>
<p>If this checkbox is checked, a factor is used to reduce the
self-victory value by one fifth every round, so that from round five on,
it is zero.</p>
<h4 id="categories">Categories</h4>
<p>Imagine you’ve got a tournament where you want to have separate
standings tables for different categories of players, e.g. youngsters or
below rating 1500. In this case, you can use the categories option. Here
you have to define your categories together with an abbreviation for
every category. Say you want to have the categories “Rating &lt; 1500”
and “Female”. Then you could define these categories and their
abbreviations here as</p>
<pre><code>r15=Rating &lt; 1500, f=Females</code></pre>
<p>You must use commas here to separate different categories and you
must use the equality sign to separate abbreviation from full category
name. The abbreviations shall be used in the players table to assign one
or more categories to a player. Also the abbreviations are used in the
filenames for the reports. The full category names are used in the
header of the reports. The abbreviations must not contain any spaces or
commas or other special characters. Only a-z, A-Z and 0-9 are
allowed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="time-bonus">Time Bonus</h4>
<p>The program offers the option of calculating different thinking times
to compensate for rating differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>The calculated times are only displayed in the HTML pairing table,
which can be accessed via the menu item Lists/Pairings/Results.</li>
<li>The time bonus field contains the parameters for this. An example of
an entry is <em>curve=expo, min=5, sum=40, fak=0.006</em></li>
<li>Please note that the comma always serves as the field separator and
the point as the decimal separator, regardless of the computer’s current
cultural settings.</li>
<li>If something is wrong with the parameters entered, no times are
displayed at all or -1 is displayed everywhere as the time. In this case
you should look in the log file or send the log file to the author.</li>
<li>If the first character of the time bonus field is a <em>#</em>, the
time bonus field is ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program calculates the thinking times for the players in the case
<em>curve=expo</em> as follows (other curve types are not
implemented):</p>
<pre><code>diff = Math.Abs(Rating1 - Rating2);
TIMEstronger = (int)Math.Round(min + (sum - 2 * min) / (1 + Math.Exp(fak * diff)), 0);
TIMEweaker = tbSum - TIMEstronger;</code></pre>
<p>The following always applies to this formula, regardless of the
values for <em>min, sum and fak:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The summed thinking time of both players is equal to
<em>sum</em>.</li>
<li>Each player always gets at least <em>min</em> thinking time.</li>
<li>If the rating difference is very large, the stronger player has
<em>min</em> thinking time and the weaker player gets <em>sum -
min</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few examples with the parameters: <em>curve=expo, min=5,
sum=40, fak=0.006</em></p>

<h3 id="lists-menu">Lists menu</h3>
<p>By selecting an entry in the lists menu, output lists will be
generated in the folder <em>export</em>. The type of outputs to be
generated can be selected on the <em>Settings</em> tab.</p>
<h4 id="html-output">Html Output</h4>
<p>The html output consists of general css which is the same for every
table and html which contains the real data. The css is taken from the
file <em>export/keizer.css</em> which should stay untouched. You can
change the user.css to match your own needs if you want to.</p>
<p>The data tables get the following tags, where the stuff in
<em>{}</em> is replaced by real data:</p>
<pre><code>id=&#39;kfc-{tournament name}-{table type}-{current round}&#39;
class=&#39;my-wrapper kfc-wrapper kfc-wrapper-{number of columns}&#39;
/* The cross table can get very wide, so it gets the different css classes: */
class=&#39;my-exwrapper kfc-exwrapper kfc-exwrapper-{number of columns}&#39;</code></pre>
<h4 id="cross-table-details">Cross table details</h4>
<h5 id="rank-pb">Rank-Pb</h5>
<p>The column <em>Rank-Pb</em> stands for
“Keizer-<em>Rank</em>-<em>P</em>oints <em>b</em>efore the current
round”. If you hover over the column header of the html with a mouse,
you’ll see a tooltip.</p>
<p>I’ll try to explain.</p>
<p>The Keizer points a player A gets for a victory against Player B is
just this value, Rank-Pb. I’ve introduced the column for purposes of
manually recalculating the Keizer points. There were questions by club
mates…</p>
<p>Cf. the screenshot below, which is a part of a table of an example
tournament.</p>
<p>You see for example Rank-Pb of player 4 (Sascha) is 22. This means,
in the round before this one, Sascha was placed such in the table, that
his “value” is 22 Keizer-Rank-Points. Which means, that you get 22
points for every victory against Sascha. And, because Andreas has won
against Sascha in round 1, he’s got 22 Keizer-points for that. Which you
can see in the table under R1.</p>
<p>Another one: Rank-Pb of player 2 (Andreas) is 23. Therefore: Axel,
who drew in round 2 against Andreas, got 11.5 (11.5 = 23 / 2) Keizer
points for that draw.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="players-menu">Players menu</h3>
<h4 id="import-players">Import players</h4>
<p>You can import a list of players in csv format. The name and rating
of the players are imported. The format of the csv file is determined by
the first line of the file. In the first line separators (semicolon,
colon or comma), the text <em>Name</em> and the text <em>Rating</em> are
searched for. The rest of the file is read according to the format of
the first line. Example: The first line of the csv file is</p>
<pre><code>x;x;;xxx;Name;;Rating</code></pre>
<p>Then the separator is the semicolon, the player names are in the 5th
column, the ratings of the players in the 7th.</p>
<h4 id="delete-all">Delete All</h4>
<p>Deletes all players. This is useful if you want to create a
tournament B which shall have exactly the same settings as previous
tournament A. In this case, copy A.s3db to B.s3db, then delete all
played rounds, then delete all players. To make sure that you don’t
accidentally delete your current tournament, deleting all players is
only possible without any games in the database.</p>
<h4 id="rebase-player-ids">Rebase player ids</h4>
<p>After importing a list of players, e.g. the club members, and then
deleting those not playing in the tournament, the player list in
KeizerForClubs may have a lot of holes in the sequence of player ids.
This is a bit annoying. Especially as you can’t see from the highest
player id the number of participants in the tournament.<br />
You can use <em>Rebase player ids</em> to remove the holes in the
sequence of ids.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="automated-post-processing-of-tables">Automated post-processing
of tables</h3>
<p>It may be desirable to do something automatically with generated
tables immediately after they have been created. For example, you may
want to upload the tables somewhere or you may want to change or add to
the tables in one way or another. You can imagine many things.</p>
<p>In KeizerForClubs there is an interface for this: If there is a
<code>script</code> directory next to the <code>export</code> directory
and there is a file called <code>kfcpost.cmd</code> in the directory,
this file is called as a batch file and the path to the table just
created is passed as a parameter. You can of course call all other
possible commands from this cmd file.</p>

<h4 id="keizer-swiss-hybrid-systems">Keizer-Swiss Hybrid Systems</h4>
<p>One can think of many different Keizer-Swiss hybrid systems. With
KeizerForClubs, you can create lots of them. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A victory against anybody counts one point plus fine evaluation.
Similar to Swiss.</li>
<li>Colors are managed like in Keizer.</li>
<li>Players that are not there can get fractions of points like in
Keizer or Swiss with bye’s.</li>
<li>Players which have games against resigned players get full points
like in Swiss.</li>
<li>Principally, a player can play against another one twice, like in
Keizer - or not, like in Swiss. This can be managed completely by the
tournament director by increasing the setting “# rounds before pairing
repeat” beyond the number of rounds of the tournament.</li>

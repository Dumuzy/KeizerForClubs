<h3 id="its-for-free">It’s for free?</h3>
<p>Yes, and that won’t change. Also no advirtising banners or other
crap, it’s simply freeware. The keizer system is not well known, and i
believe this should change. This software tries to help with that. If
you want to help me to improve the software or the documentation, drop
me a line. But you aer not obliged to anything.</p>
<h3 id="is-the-software-reliable">Is the software reliable?</h3>
<p>It has been developed using best practices and known techniques, and
has been tested thoroughly. Improvements are always possible and errors
cannot be avoided…so it’s a good idea to try a few rounds in a test
tournament using fictive participants and results.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-install">How to install?</h3>
<p>Download the zip-archive and extract it.</p>
<h3 id="a-game-result-is-wrong-what-do-i-do">A game result is wrong,
what do i do?</h3>
<p>Go to the tab pairings, select the round and correct the result for
the game. Draw lots for the current round if needed.</p>
<h3 id="can-someone-enter-the-tournament-in-later-rounds">Can someone
enter the tournament in later rounds?</h3>
<p>Yes, simply add him in the players tab. He will appear immediately in
coming pairings, ranking tables etc. There is no need for changes in
earlier rounds!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-option-distribute-byes-for">What is the option
“distribute bye’s” for?</h3>
<p>The Keizer system gives free tickets by default to the worst ranked
player. This option avoids giving them to players who have been
non-playing already. The option ensures that no player gets a free
ticket all the time and therefore appears for nothing at the game
evening.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-option-rounds-before-pairings-repeat-for">What is
the option “# rounds before pairings repeat” for?</h3>
<p>In the Keizer system, pairings are allowed to repeat. Because of the
pairing between neighbors in the table, this could happen directly in
the next round, if the table does not change much. This option sets how
many rounds have to pass before the same pairing is allowed again.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-print-participants-game-results">How to print
participants, game results, …?</h3>
<p>Use menu “Lists”. All lists are saved as html-, xml- or txt-file and
can be displayed with your web browser, which is used as printing
program. All files are written to the folder “export” and can easily be
used for e.g. copying the html files to your club website.</p>
<h3 id="there-is-no-save-button">There is no save button?!</h3>
<p>Right, unnecessary - every change is directly committed to the
tournament database.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-i-do-pairing-manually">Why should i do pairing
manually?</h3>
<p>This might be necessary if no PC is available at the club: the
tournament director will do the pairings manually according to the
current ranking and enter the results later into the program. Or the
automatic pairings are not “nice” for whatever reason and all
participants want to see it changed.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-like-the-pairings-for-the-next-round.">I dont like the
pairings for the next round.</h3>
<p>Use “delete last round” to drop the latest pairings. Change options
regarding the automatic pairing or do it manually.</p>

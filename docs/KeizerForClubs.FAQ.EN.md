### It's for free?
Yes, and that won't change. Also no advirtising banners or other crap, it's simply freeware. The
keizer system is not well known, and i believe this should change. This software tries to help with
that. If you want to help me to improve the software or the documentation, drop me a line. But you
aer not obliged to anything.

### Is the software reliable?
It has been developed using best practices and known techniques, and has been tested thoroughly.
Improvements are always possible and errors cannot be avoided...so it's a good idea to try a few
rounds in a test tournament using fictive participants and results.

### How to install?
Download the zip-archive and extract it.

### A game result is wrong, what do i do?
Go to the tab pairings, select the round and correct the result for the game. Draw lots for the current
round if needed.

### Can someone enter the tournament in later rounds?
Yes, simply add him in the players tab. He will appear immediately in coming pairings, ranking
tables etc. There is no need for changes in earlier rounds!

### What is the option "distribute bye's" for?
The Keizer system gives free tickets by default to the worst ranked player. This option avoids giving them 
to players who have been non-playing already. The option ensures that no player gets a free ticket all the 
time and therefore appears for nothing at the game evening.

###  What is the option "# rounds before pairings repeat" for?
In the Keizer system, pairings are allowed to repeat. Because of the pairing between
neighbors in the table, this could happen directly in the next round, if the table does not change much. 
This option sets how many rounds have to pass before the same pairing is allowed again. 

### How to print participants, game results, ...?
Use menu "Lists". All lists are saved as html-, xml- or txt-file and can be displayed with your web browser,
which is used as printing program.
All files are written to the folder "export" and can easily be used for e.g. copying the html files to
your club website. 

### There is no save button?!
Right, unnecessary - every change is directly committed to the tournament database.

### Why should i do pairing manually?
This might be necessary if no PC is available at the club: the tournament director will do the
pairings manually according to the current ranking and enter the results later into the program.
Or the automatic pairings are not "nice" for whatever reason and all participants want to see it
changed.

### I dont like the pairings for the next round.
Use "delete last round" to drop the latest pairings. Change options regarding the automatic pairing
or do it manually.
